# 🤖 AI Resume Screening System with LangSmith Tracing

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI Resume Screening System is an intelligent recruitment assistant built using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **LangSmith**. It automates the process of analyzing resumes, extracting skills, matching candidates against job requirements, calculating suitability scores, and generating transparent explanations for hiring decisions.

This project was developed as part of the **Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship (February 2026) Task 3**.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Skill Extraction

Extracts candidate skills, tools, education, experience, and domain expertise directly from resumes.

### ✅ Resume Matching

Compares extracted candidate information against a job description.

### ✅ Candidate Scoring

Generates a suitability score between **0–100** based on:

| Criteria         | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Skills Match     | 40%    |
| Experience Match | 30%    |
| Tools Match      | 20%    |
| Education Match  | 10%    |

### ✅ Explainable AI

Provides a clear explanation of why the candidate received a particular score.

### ✅ LangSmith Tracing

Tracks every LangChain invocation for debugging, monitoring, and observability.

### ✅ Few-Shot Prompting

Uses example-driven prompting to improve consistency and output quality.
